# Example Render manifest for deploying CodeShare
# Edit names, branch, and env var references as needed before using.
# This file is optional â€” you can also configure services via the Render dashboard.

    env: node
    region: oregon
    plan: free

# Notes:
# - For security, do NOT put secrets in this file (set them through Render dashboard or CLI instead).
# - Replace 'main' with the branch you deploy from.
# - After deploying, set the env vars (MONGODB_URL, FRONTEND_URL, VITE_BACKEND_URL) in the Render UI.
